# Checkers AI Game

## Overview

This project is a Python-based implementation of the classic Checkers game with an AI opponent. The AI uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to make competitive moves, providing a challenging experience for the player. The game features a graphical user interface built with Pygame.

## Features

- **Human vs. AI Gameplay**: Play against an AI opponent that evaluates moves to provide a competitive challenge.
- **Minimax Algorithm**: The AI uses the Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning to optimize its decision-making process.
- **Graphical Interface**: The game board, pieces, and moves are visually displayed using Pygame.
- **Valid Move Indicators**: Highlights valid moves for the selected piece to enhance the gameplay experience.
